                  <b>You’ve just found out that you’re being charged with a felony, and you’re worried about what it
                    means for your life
                    going forward. You definitely don’t want to go to prison, have to pay fines, go on parole, or attend
                    court-ordered
                    classes.
                    If you lose your case and are formally charged with a felony, you may also face consequences that
                    could impact you on
                    many levels. For instance, you could have trouble securing a job or housing. Then what? What’s going
                    to become of your
                    life? For instance, you could have trouble securing a job or housing. Then what? What’s going to
                    become of your life?</b>
                  <p>Right now, the best thing to do is learn about what exactly a felony is, the kind of charges you
                    may be contending with,
                    and how long a felony will stay on your record. It could give you some peace of mind during this
                    turbulent time.
                    And as you may know, arming yourself with the right knowledge is only the first step. The second
                    step is to get in touch
                    with a local criminal defense lawyer in West Palm Beach to discuss the details of your case and see
                    what they can do for
                    you.</p>

                  <h5 class="title-5">What Does “Felony” Mean?</h5>
                  <p>There are three types of crimes: infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies.</p>
                  <p>Infractions are the least serious types of crimes and are also called violations. Usually, traffic
                    offenses are labeled
                    as infractions. You don’t get the right to access a lawyer and there is no jury trial when it comes
                    to this type of
                    charge. You may get points on your license and/or have to pay a fine if you get an infraction.
                    Misdemeanors are more serious, and could result in up to a year in jail time in Florida. Crimes are
                    classified as
                    first-degree and second-degree misdemeanors. You may also have to pay a fine up to $1,000 and be
                    forced to go on
                    probation for up to one year.
                    Felonies are the most serious type of crime. In Florida, there are capital and life felonies and
                    first-, second-, and
                    third-degree felonies.</p>
                  <p>If you commit a capital or life felony, you could go to state prison for life and have to pay a
                    fine up to $15,000, or
                    be sentenced to the death penalty in extreme cases. There is no statute of limitations for capital
                    and life felonies as
                    well as felonies where a death occurred.
                    Felonies of the first degree could result in up to 30 years in state prison and a fine of up to
                    $1,000. The statute of
                    limitations is four years for a first-degree felony and three years for a second- or third-degree
                    felony.
                    Second-degree felonies could result in up to 15 years in state prison and a fine up of up to
                    $10,000. Third-degree
                    felonies could result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000.
                    Additionally, if you have been convicted with two or more felonies and then you get a third
                    conviction, you could have
                    to go to jail for a longer amount of time.</p>
                  <h5 class="title-5">How Long Will a Felony Stay on Your Record in Florida?</h5>
                  <p>In Florida, a felony will stay on your record for all time, which can affect many different areas
                    of your life.
                  </p>
                  <p>If you work with a skilled criminal defense lawyer in Florida, however, you could possibly avoid a
                    conviction in the
                    first place so you don’t have any issues moving forward.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="title-5">Different Types of Felony Crimes</h5>
                  <p>There are a number of crimes that could result in a felony charge in Florida. They include:</p>
